# StarWars-Source
A plugin for EventScripts Classic (Counter-Strike: Source) where you get Star Wars skins and your weapon projectiles become lasers. Originally by b4p in 2006, but I became a collaborator in 2011.

## Description
StarWars:Source allows you to play CS:S in the StarWars universe

## Updates
### v1.1.1 (september 2011)
* Now works on the Orange Box engine. The script broke Summer 2011, but works again now.
